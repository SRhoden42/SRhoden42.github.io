## Wellington's Free Art Studio

One of the only things I googled when I found out that we were moving to New Zealand was “art studios in Wellington”. I found this place called Vincent's Art Workshop, a free art studio for anyone living around Wellington. 

When I got to Wellington I went and signed up as an artist. It was super easy, all I had it do was fill out this form and then I could come anytime I wanted and make art. What was really the draw for me was their “Clay Room” where you can make ceramics. I studied ceramics in my university and really wanted to continue my practice here in Wellington. 

However, there is a safety and introduction course they have you do before allowing you to do ceramics there. So I had to wait a few weeks before the next available introduction. In the meantime I made use of their wood shop and made some ribs for throwing later. 

The space is amazing, the staff are all so friendly and happy to help get you set up working in any media. They have, like I mentioned, a clay room, wood shop, printing press, sewing machine, loads of literature to study, and supplies to paint and draw. 

If you find yourself living in Wellington I highly recommend going over and checking out Vincent’s Art Workshop.
