## Adventures in Ski Instructing

When I arrived in New Zealand it was winter, which was weird for me because back home June and July were summer. Anywho, I really wanted to get on a ski mountain for the season, so I emailed every ski field I could asking if they had any positions I could fill. Tukino Ski Field on Mt. Ruapehu wrote back saying they had a volunteer ski instructor position open. I would help teach the Ski Squad, which were school aged kids, the basics of skiing and they would provide me a place to sleep and food. 

So when the time came I packed my bag and caught a ride up to the mountain. What I found was like no other skiing experience I had encountered in the states. There were 3 lodged that were owned and maintained by the club, and the whole mountain was run by volunteers like myself. 

The first hurdle I encountered was the “rope tow” which is basically a pulley that you use a little metal clamp on a harness to attach yourself to it and get pulled up the mountain. For the first day I was the one being shown the ropes. Literally. My first day was rough with the rope tow and all and never having done ski instructing before. However, that evening I got a crash course from a certified instructor and I was successfully able to teach the skills to the kids the next day. 

One day after my teaching was done, one of the parents from the lodge and one of the ski patrol guys took me up to the top of the mountain. I was keeping up with them alright until we came to the top of this Black Diamond run which was practically straight down this hill. The ski patrol guy went first and I followed. To get to where he went I needed to pretty much point my skis straight down the mountain to have enough speed to get up the next hill. So I counted down from 5 in my head and sent it, and I went FLYING so fast. Then Boom! At the end I hit a little patch of ice, lost control and hit a full yard sell. Both my skis popped off and my poles went flying. 

I gathered up my gear and kept going, but when I got down the mountain I realized that my thumb was hurting pretty bad. I had one of the ski patrol guys look at it. He said it wasn't broken so he just said to go put some snow on it and when I got back he would give me a beer. 

That evening I got it wrapped up and kept going. By the next weekend I was back to 100% and finished out the season without any more hiccups. It was really cool to become part of the community up there. I really enjoyed evenings in the lodge, everyone sitting around the lounge cooking, drinking, and telling stories. All in all it was a pretty awesome season. 

For my fellow travelers looking to do something similar, there are lodge host positions at each of the three lodges that can accommodate couples. You get to stay up on the mountain for the whole season, or you can do what I did and join the volunteer crew that comes up on weekends.
