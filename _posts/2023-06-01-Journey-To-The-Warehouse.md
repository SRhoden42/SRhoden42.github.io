## Journey To The Warehouse

It's my first week in this new country. I have explored around a little bit, got the essentials and such ya know a charger block for my phone and a new cord for my laptop. At this point my family and I are still living out of our suitcases in a furnished rental. It was a nice feeling to be honest living with just a few belongings. 

I feel the need one day to hang up some of my jackets and things on the walls so I decide to go out to The Warehouse. The Warehouse for my non-NZ friends is sorta like a Walmart just without the food and guns, your basic homegoods and clothes and such. 

So I set out on foot to the closest Warehouse. I get my command hooks no problem. It was even a good little walk. I took the route through ‚ÄúThe Honking Tunnel‚Äù (If you live in Wellington you know the one). On my way back I decided to rent one of the scooters that are all over town because it seems fun and I‚Äôd only ever ridden one once before. I rent it and check my google maps to get a heading to get back home and I‚Äôm off.

Everything is going great until I hit the bus tunnel. It is a tunnel just for the buses and I have no idea when the next bus would be coming through it. I decide I don‚Äôt want to meet a bus head on with my scooter, so I park it and decide to go over the mountain on foot instead. 

There I am hiking along when the trees and terrain start to feel really familiar. Like I‚Äôve seen it before. I‚Äôm IN the forest where the Hobbits hid from the Nazguls in the first LOTR movie! The trees are so tall and it‚Äôs starting to get dusky dark so it feels like I‚Äôm in the movie. I hike along until I find the exact spot where they filmed the scene. 

Naturally I ran up and slid down into the little spot just like in the movie and hid from the imaginary Nazgul for a minute. 

After I had my fun I finished my hike over the mountain and my journey home. Command hooks in hand and a successful adventure under my belt.
