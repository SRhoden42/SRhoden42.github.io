Welcome to Spencer's Adventures!

The tale of a 21 year old that up and moved halfway across the world to the beautiful Aotearoa (Maori for New Zealand)!
I have made so many great friends and had some amazing experinces so far, and I believe this is just the beginning.

First a little about me. 

I grew up in Bryant, Arkansas in the USA, a growing town just south of the state's capital. I had a love for adventure and the great outdoors from a young age. I was involved in the Scouts BSA program and thats really where my love for adventure started. I would frequently go on backpacking trips (or tramping for my New Zealand friends) in the beautiful Ouchita and Ozark Mountians in Arkansas. There was something just so satisfying about hiking for 20-30 miles with nothing but what you could carry on your back. I also was introduced to travel at a young age. My family would take trips every spring break and over the thanksgiving holiday. We went to New York City to see Jason Marz in Carnige Hall, Many trips out to New Mexico and Colorado to go skiing, and down to Orange Beach in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Enough about the past.

This blog will follow my adventures throughout New Zealand and beyond!
I plan to make a blog post every week about the adventures from that week big or small!

This is also a work in progress, in the future I would like to build a community around this blog. I want to add a comment section, first time travelers tips and tricks, and share any useful reasources I find to help new travelers get out there!


Happy Trails,
Spencer
