Welcome to Spencer's Adventures!

The tale of a 21 year old that up and moved halfway across the world to the beautiful Aotearoa (New Zealand)!
I have made so many great friends and had some amazing experinces so far, and I believe this is just the beginning.

First a little about me. 

I grew up in Bryant, Arkansas, USA, a growing town just south of the state's capital. I had a love for adventure and the great outdoors from a young age. I was involved in the Scouts BSA program and thats really where my love for adventure started. I would frequently go on backpacking trips (or tramping for my New Zealand friends) in the beautiful Ouchita and Ozark Mountians in Arkansas. I was also introduced to travel at a young age, and I learned that I loved exploring new places and learning about other cultures. 

Enough about the past.

This blog will follow my adventures throughout New Zealand and beyond! I'm starting this in January of 2025 so I have a little catching up to do. (We moved in June of 2023) I plan to write about cool spots I find, interesting encounters, things I learned, and some self reflections. 

This is also a work in progress, in the future I would like to build a community around this blog. I want to add a comment section, first time travelers tips and tricks, and share any useful reasources I find to help new travelers get out there!


Happy Trails,
Spencer
