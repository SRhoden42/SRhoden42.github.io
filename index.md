Welcome to Spencer's Adventures!

The tale of a 21 year old that up and moved halfway across the world to the beautiful Aotearoa (Maori for New Zealand)!
I have made so many great friends and had some amazing experinces so far, and I believe this is just the beginning.

First a little about me. 
I grew up in Bryant, Arkansas in the USA, a growing town just south of the state's capital. I had a love for adventure and the great outdoors from a young age. I was involved in the Scouts BSA program and thats really where my love for adventure started. I would frequently go on backpacking trips (or tramping for my New Zealand friends) in the beautiful Ouchita and Ozark Mountians in Arkansas. There was something just so satisfying about hiking for 20-30 miles with nothing but what you could carry on your back. I also was introduced to travel at a young age. My family would take trips every spring break and over the thanksgiving holiday. We went to New York City to see Jason Marz in Carnige Hall, Many trips out to New Mexico and Colorado to go skiing, and down to Orange Beach in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Or maybe what you plan to blog about.
